# Write a Blockchain Runtime with Substrate

## Target Audience

This presentation is aimed at developers with some (but not necessarily a lot) of experience with the Rust programming language and little or no experience with Blockchain.

## Original Talk Description
Parity Substrate is a next-generation blockchain framework for innovation. With Substrate, it is easy to build your own decentralized application entirely in Rust. In this workshop, we will setup a Substrate development environment, build a blockchain by composing pre-written runtime modules, and then write our own custom runtime module. Attendees will learn fundamental decentralization and blockchain principles, gain hands-on experience with the Substrate framework, and learn concrete next steps to build their own blockchain projects.
